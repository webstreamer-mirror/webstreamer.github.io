# Real-Time Communication
Real-time communication is playing a much more important role in our daily life nowadays. It not only includes the telephony in the conventional sense, but also contains mobile and cellular telephone, IM (instant messaging), VoIP (Voice over IP, also called Internet telephone), IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or other chatting modes and so on. There is a significant delay between the transmission and the receipt of the information when communicating in timeshifting mode, such as leaving messages by email, on a bulletin board or on a blog. While real-time communication shares information and interacts with people through network connections just as if they were face-to-face. Itâ€™s usually a peer-to-peer connection with minimal latency. Moreover, the growing demands for real-time communications with high quality arouse many new multimedia technologies. These newly developed technologies and solutions give users better experience and also help traditional industries evolve and become more competitive. And webstreamer is a multimedia solution to make real-time communications via web much easier. Here, we list several application scenarios which could be implemented by webstreamer.
