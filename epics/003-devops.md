# Development and Operation consideation

Webstreamer is  a project  to make the multimedia development easy. To meet such goal, the webstreamer software developers have to good at C/C++/Javascript(Browser/Node) and Multimedia knowledage, but it's not easy. So we must establish some development infrastructure to let every one easy to work on other people's delivery, for example 'easy to get','easy to use'. 

*  as an open source project, every one should easy to get the source code (as we use git ,this has been solved.)

* every body has the some build and runing enviroment, so that easy to test, debug, and reproduce issue.

* effectivity docs to guide others work on the delivered job.

for now, DevOps is become very hot, we have some solution on this requiremnt.
